## Acknowledgments

---

I would like to thank the following technologies for making this project possible:

- [React](https://react.dev/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allowed me to easily create reusable components and manage the state of the application.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type annotations and other features to the language. TypeScript helped me catch errors early and write more maintainable code.

- [emailjs-com](https://www.emailjs.com/) - A service that allows you to send email directly from JavaScript code. emailjs-com made it easy for me to create a contact form that sends messages directly to my email inbox.

- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - A library of icons for React applications. react-icons provided a wide variety of icons that I could easily use in my application without having to create them from scratch.

- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - A library for styling React components using CSS-in-JS syntax. styled-components allowed me to write CSS directly in my JavaScript code, which made it easy to manage styles and avoid naming collisions.

Without these technologies, this project would not have been possible. I am grateful for the contributions of the developers who created and maintain these libraries, and for the open-source community that supports them.
